# Group Project Module 1 -- ENIAC Women

This is the repository of the first project made by ENIAC Women at the Adalab bootcamp.

## About ENIAC Women

We are a group of five women changing our lives and learning at Adalab to become Front-End Developers.

## About our project

This is the first project we confront as future front-end developers. We had to create a website about our group only using HTML and SCSS with the help of tools like Gulp and Git.
